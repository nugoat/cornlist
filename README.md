Cornlist
========

## About
This is a list of ingredients that contain corn or a derivative of corn in some form.

The goal of this project is to create a authoritative listing of corn-based ingredients so that those with an allergy or sensitivity to corn can reduce their exposure to risk when selecting products.

This list is a work in progress and carries no guarantee or warranty of any kind. What you put into your body, or the body of someone you are caring for is entirely your responsibility.

This list was created using many of the items listed on Jenny Connorsâ€™ [Corn Allergen List](http://www.cornallergens.com/list/corn-allergen-list.php/ "Jenny Connors' Corn Allergen List").


## To-do
I want to do stuff like:

- Use the open data license
- Add a link to the Wikipedia entry for each item if applicable
- Add a link to the PubChem page for each item if applicable
- Add the European E-Number for each entry if applicable
- Add a list of synonyms if applicable
- And do it all in an nice "open data" sort of way
- And use GitHub pages to display it in a nice responsive way
- And export it to a pretty PDF for easy printing

Of course, not all of that will be acomplished on GitHub, but the data will be stored and updated right here.
