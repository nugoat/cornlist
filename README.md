cornlist
========

This is a list of ingredients that contain corn or a derivative of corn in some form.

The goal of this project is to create a authoritative listing of corn-based ingredients so that those with an allergy or sensitivity to corn can reduce their exposure to risk when selecting products.

This list is a work in progress and carries no guarantee or warranty of any kind. What you put into your body, or the body of someone you are caring for is entirely your responsibility.

This list was created using many of the ingredients listed on Jenny Connorsâ€™ [Corn Allergen List](http://www.cornallergens.com/list/corn-allergen-list.php/ "Jenny Connors' Corn Allergen List").
